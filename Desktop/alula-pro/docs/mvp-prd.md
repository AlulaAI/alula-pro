# Lightweight Client Management System for Elder Care Consultants

### TL;DR

Elder care consultants struggle to maintain context when multiple family members communicate through various channels, resulting in scattered information and missed urgent needs. This lightweight system consolidates emails and manual notes, uses AI to flag urgent issues, and provides a clear, mobile-friendly dashboard—enabling consultants to respond quickly and maintain comprehensive client records. The system ensures that, upon login, consultants see a prioritized action plan with all necessary context, enabling immediate, informed action without searching. All user-facing copy and microcopy are crafted to reflect empathy, respect, and positive, person-centered language, in alignment with the principles of a positive approach to care.

---

## Copy and Microcopy Requirements: Positive, Person-Centered Language

### Principles

* All user-facing text, prompts, and notifications must use supportive, strengths-based, and person-centered language.

* Copy and microcopy should reflect empathy, respect, and positive language, in alignment with the principles of a positive approach to care (without using any trademarked or proprietary IP).

* Avoid clinical jargon, negative framing, or any language that could be perceived as dismissive or stigmatizing.

* All communications should empower consultants and families, focusing on abilities, choices, and partnership.

### Review Process

* All copy and microcopy must undergo a review process to ensure alignment with these principles.

* Regular audits of user-facing text will be conducted to maintain consistency and adherence.

* Feedback from consultants and users will be incorporated to continuously improve the tone and clarity of all communications.

---

## Sample Copy and Microcopy

All user-facing copy and microcopy should model a positive, empathetic, and person-centered approach. The following examples serve as a reference for all text throughout the app and should be used as a standard for tone and language in all user-facing features.

### Dashboard Welcome

* “Good morning, \[Consultant Name\]! Here’s what matters most for your clients today.”

* “You’re making a difference. Let’s see who needs your support right now.”

### Urgent Action Cards

* “This family is reaching out for help. Let’s see how you can support them.”

* “A new message from \[Family Member\]: ‘I’m worried about Mom.’ Tap to review and respond.”

### LLM Summary Context

* “Here’s a summary of recent conversations and updates for \[Client Name\].”

* “We’ve gathered these details to help you respond with confidence.”

### Reply to Correspondence

* “Send a caring response”

* “Your reply will help this family feel heard and supported.”

### Internal Notes

* “Add a private note about this conversation (for your eyes only).”

* “Jot down your thoughts or next steps to keep everything on track.”

### Archive/Snooze

* “Not urgent? Move this to your ‘Later’ list.”

* “Snooze this action and we’ll remind you when it’s time to follow up.”

### Add Client/Contact

* “Add a new client to your care circle.”

* “Who else is involved in \[Client Name\]’s support network?”

### General Microcopy

## Narrative

Sarah is an elder care consultant juggling a dozen clients, each with multiple family members reaching out via email, phone, and text. On Monday morning, she logs into the new client management system from her phone. Instantly, her dashboard highlights three urgent client needs—one flagged by the system’s AI as a crisis email from a new family contact.

Sarah clicks into the flagged client, where she sees the urgent email at the top, along with a timeline of previous communications and her own internal notes. The LLM-generated summary gives her a quick overview and lists the emails and notes it used, so she can trust the summary. She quickly replies to the urgent email directly from the action view and adds an internal note linked to her response, documenting her reasoning.

Throughout her day, Sarah notices that every prompt, notification, and message in the app is written in a supportive, respectful, and person-centered way, as modeled in the Sample Copy and Microcopy section. She feels empowered and valued, and her clients and their families notice the difference in communication. For less urgent items, Sarah snoozes the actions to review later. By the end of the day, Sarah has addressed every urgent need, updated her notes, and feels in control—no more digging through scattered emails or sticky notes. Her clients and their families notice the difference, and her business thrives.
