# Mobile UX Redesign - Task Management Workflow

## Overview
The mobile task card has been completely redesigned with a progressive disclosure workflow that guides consultants through a clear, intuitive process.

## Design Principles
1. **One Thing at a Time** - Each screen focuses on a single primary action
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Information revealed as needed, not all at once
3. **Clear Visual Hierarchy** - Most important information prominently displayed
4. **Thumb-Friendly** - Primary actions within easy reach at bottom of screen
5. **Contextual Actions** - Show relevant options based on urgency and client type

## Workflow States

### 1. Message View (Initial State)
**Purpose**: Read and understand the client's message
- Clean header with client avatar and name
- Full email content takes center stage
- Single primary CTA: "View Context & Recommendations"
- Secondary option to archive without action

### 2. Context View
**Purpose**: Understand client history and AI recommendations
- Back navigation to message
- Client type and priority badges
- Key context in blue highlight box
- AI recommendations in amber highlight box
- Recent communication history (if applicable)
- Primary CTA: "Compose Reply"
- Call button for critical urgencies

### 3. Reply View
**Purpose**: Compose and send response
- Clean composer interface
- Quick response templates for common replies
- Large text area for easy typing
- Single action: "Send Reply"

### 4. Complete View
**Purpose**: Add optional notes and time tracking
- Success confirmation with green checkmark
- Optional internal note field (yellow background)
- Optional time tracking input
- Final action: "Complete Task"

## Visual Design Elements

### Progress Indicator
- Horizontal progress bar at top of screen
- Shows current position in workflow (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Smooth animations between states

### Color System
- **Blue (#87CEEB)**: Primary actions, progress
- **Dark (#10292E)**: Secondary actions
- **Red**: Critical urgency indicators
- **Green**: Success states
- **Amber**: AI recommendations
- **Yellow**: Internal notes

### Animations
- Slide transitions between states (left to right flow)
- Smooth progress bar updates
- Scale animation for success state

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: One decision at a time
2. **Clear Path Forward**: Always obvious what to do next
3. **Mobile-Optimized**: Large touch targets, readable text
4. **Faster Task Completion**: Streamlined workflow
5. **Better Context**: Information presented when needed

## Implementation Notes

- Uses motion/react for smooth animations
- Fully responsive with overflow scrolling
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Backwards compatible with current data structure
- Gesture support ready (swipe between cards)

## Future Enhancements

1. Swipe gestures between workflow states
2. Voice-to-text for reply composition
3. Smart reply suggestions based on context
4. Offline support with sync
5. Haptic feedback for key actions
