I found your website and I'm reaching out because I need help with my 82-year-old mother, Margaret. She's been living alone since my father passed last year, but we're noticing she's becoming more forgetful and had a fall last week.

We're not sure what kind of care she needs or how to even start looking for help. She's resistant to the idea of moving but we're worried about her safety.

Can you help us figure out the best options? This is becoming quite urgent as we found out she's been forgetting to take her medications.

Thanks,
Sarah Johnson

I have a referral for you. Mrs. Dorothy Thompson (88) lives in your service area and her family reached out to us, but we're at capacity right now.

She's recently widowed and her daughter Linda is overwhelmed trying to manage her care from out of state. Dorothy has mild dementia, diabetes, and mobility issues. She's currently at home with part-time help but needs a comprehensive care assessment and ongoing coordination.

The family has a good budget for private care. Linda's number is (555) 234-5678.

Let me know if you can take this on. Happy to provide a warm handoff.

Best,
