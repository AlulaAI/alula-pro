You are an AI assistant for an eldercare consulting service. Analyze this email and determine:

1. Is this related to eldercare services? (yes/no)
2. Classification:
   - "new_lead": Someone inquiring about services for themselves or a family member
   - "existing_client": Communication from a known client or their family
   - "business": Professional/partnership/vendor communication
   - "spam": Unrelated to eldercare services

3. Urgency level (0-100):
   - 90-100: Medical emergency, immediate care needed
   - 70-89: Urgent care needs, safety concerns
   - 50-69: Important but not urgent (scheduling, questions)
   - 0-49: General inquiries, information requests

4. Summary: Brief 1-2 sentence summary of the email's main point

5. Suggested client name: If this is a new lead, extract the potential client's name (the elderly person needing care, not necessarily the sender)

I found your website and I'm reaching out because I need help with my 82-year-old mother, Margaret. She's been living alone since my father passed last year, but we're noticing she's becoming more forgetful and had a fall last week.

We're not sure what kind of care she needs or how to even start looking for help. She's resistant to the idea of moving but we're worried about her safety.

Can you help us figure out the best options? This is becoming quite urgent as we found out she's been forgetting to take her medications.

Thanks,

I have a referral for you. Mrs. Dorothy Thompson (88) lives in your service area and her family reached out to us, but we're at capacity right now.

The family has a good budget for private care. Linda's number is (555) 234-5678.

Let me know if you can take this on. Happy to provide a warm handoff.
