# Alula Complete Strategy Document (2025): Security-First Eldercare Ecosystem Platform

## Executive Summary

Alula represents a transformative opportunity in the rapidly expanding eldercare technology market. Our platform addresses the fundamental challenge of family dysfunction and poor coordination in eldercare management—the primary driver of crisis events—by creating the first comprehensive B2B2C ecosystem that empowers independent consultants as both users and family coaches.

**Strategic Approach:** Launch with a consultant-focused MVP featuring information aggregation and AI-powered insights, then expand to a family-owned data platform that creates powerful network effects through consultant-family collaboration and services marketplace integration.

**Market Opportunity:** The eldercare software market is experiencing unprecedented growth, with long-term care software reaching $6.33 billion in 2025 and projected to grow at 8.5% CAGR to $12.15 billion by 2033. The caregiver app market specifically is valued at $1.38 billion in 2023, estimated to reach $3.67 billion by 2031 at 15% CAGR.

**Competitive Advantage:** Security-first development without HIPAA constraints, family data ownership model, AI-driven family intelligence, and consultant-coached family coordination—addressing gaps that existing platforms fail to serve.
